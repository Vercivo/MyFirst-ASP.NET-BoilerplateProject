# Project Name: BookPerson (Repository Pattern)

This project is my first implementation of the **Boiler Plate Repository Pattern**, designed to help me learn and practice best practices in backend development. The goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience with the Repository Pattern and understand its benefits for data management and API development.

The project demonstrates how to separate data access logic from the business logic, ensuring that the backend code remains maintainable and scalable. The repository pattern improves testability and allows for easier swapping of data sources in the future.

I made two core classes: **Book** and **Person**, which represent the entities in the project and are used to manage data related to books and people.

## Technologies Used
- **.NET 9**: The core framework for building the application.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used for backend logic and API development.

## Design Pattern Implemented
- **Repository Pattern**: This pattern is followed to manage data access through repositories, keeping the application logic decoupled from data-related concerns.

## Key Features
- **Backend CRUD APIs**: The focus of the project is on creating robust, scalable backend APIs for managing book-related data (create, read, update, delete).
- **Data Access Layer**: Using the Repository Pattern to abstract and manage data access, improving code readability and maintainability.
- **Scalability**: The boilerplate structure is designed to support future expansion with minimal changes, making it easy to add new features.

## Additional Notes
- **Angular**: While Angular is included in the project directory for the frontend, the primary focus of this project is on backend development and API structure.
